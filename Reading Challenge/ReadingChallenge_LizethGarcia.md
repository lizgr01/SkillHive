# Reading Challenge

Books: 
- A Philosophy of Software Design (190 pages)
- The Deadline (310 pages)

Timeframe: 4 weeks

## How I plan to do it
- It’s 500 pages total among both books.
- Which means its 125 pages a week, and approximately 18 pages a day.
- I don’t like reading two books at a time, so I’m reading A Philosophy of Software Design first, and when finished I’ll start with The Deadline.
- My plan is to finish 18 pages a day, and read more when I have the time and mental energy for that, so that I can skip reading some days if I must, or read a little bit less in case I have less time and/or energy.
